### Hello, I'm Micah 👋

## I'm a 5th Year Senior Undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering 
Currently, this repository is used to hold the algorithms that I made for my Machine Learning Course with SDSMT. Please understand that I live in low-level land and have not touched Python or any other high-level language in over two years. This is probably the programs of a mad man, but that is exactly how I describe my coding style. I will try to get my VHDL code for a a custom ARM CPU that I made on a FPGA last year. 

I am a hardware guy first and a software guy second. This class, Machine Learning, was a challenge as I have not touched high-level languagues in over 2 years, so Python was shocking to my electrical roots. 

Lastly, yes. I should have gone for the masters in Electrical Engineering instead of the double major. I am currently trying to rectify this mistake by building a time machine. 

### Courese Work
Below is a list of classes I have completed in my 5 years at SDSMT. All Computer Engnieering Classes will be signified 🖥️ with and all Electrical Classes will be signified with ⚡. I will inlcude all Computer Sciecne Classes under Computer Engineering. Math Classes will be signified with 🧮. 

## List of Relevant Course Work
- 🖥️ Digital Systems
- 🖥️ Computer Architecture 
- 🖥️ ARM Assembly 
- 🖥️ Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- 🖥️ Embedded Systems
- ⚡ Electornics I & II

### Languauges
I primaraly code in C, but most of my Data Structures work was done in C++. As for the Machine Learning Course and Computer Architecture I have been using Python. I also know ARMv8 pretty well as my Assembly Languauge course was in ARMv8. Lastly, I have dabbeled in VHDL as well Java.
