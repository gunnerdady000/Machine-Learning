### Hello, I'm Micah 👋

## I'm a 5th Year Senior Undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering 
Currently, this repository is used to hold the algorithms that I made for my Machine Learning Course with SDSMT. Please understand that I live in low-level land and have not touched Python or any other high-level language in over two years. This is probably the programs of a mad man, but that is exactly how I describe my coding style. I will try to get my VHDL code for a a custom ARM CPU that I made on a FPGA last year. 

I am a hardware guy first and a software guy second. This class, Machine Learning, was a challenge as I have not touched high-level languagues in over 2 years, so Python was shocking to my electrical roots. 

Lastly, yes. I should have gone for the masters in Electrical Engineering instead of the double major. I am currently trying to rectify this mistake by building a time machine. 

### Courese Work
Below is a list of classes I have completed in my 5 years at SDSMT. All Computer Engnieering Classes will be signified 🖥️ with and all Electrical Classes will be signified with ⚡. I will inlcude all Computer Sciecne Classes under Computer Engineering. Math Classes will be signified with 🧮. 

## List of Relevant Course Work
- 🖥️ Digital Systems
- 🖥️ Computer Architecture 
- 🖥️ ARM Assembly 
- 🖥️ Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- 🖥️ Embedded Systems

### Languauges
I primaraly code in C, but most of my Data Structures work was done in C++. As for the Machine Learning Course and Computer Architecture I have been using Python. I also know ARMv8 pretty well as my Assembly Languauge course was in ARMv8. Lastly, I have dabbeled in VHDL as well Java.

### Linear Regression 

## Introduction
First, we would like to start off by saying that either the multidimensional linear regression or the polynomial regression can be used in place of the simple one-dimensional linear regression algorithm that we used. We understand that the constants can be found even quicker using the numpy library, but we wanted to explore some other functionality found within the library. We opted to do the standard equation that takes more time to calculate.  Speaking of the equation, we will explain how linear regression works first.
