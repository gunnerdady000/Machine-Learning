# Machine-Learning
This repository is used to hold the algorithms that I made for my Machine Learning Course with SDSMT. Please understand that I live in low-level land and have not touched Python or any other high-level language in over two years. This is probably the programs of a mad man, but that is exactly how I describe my coding style.
