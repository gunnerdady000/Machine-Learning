### Linear Regression 

## Introduction
First, we would like to start off by saying that either the multidimensional linear regression or the polynomial regression can be used in place of the simple one-dimensional linear regression algorithm that we used. We understand that the constants can be found even quicker using the numpy library, but we wanted to explore some other functionality found within the library. We opted to do the standard equation that takes more time to calculate.  Speaking of the equation, we will explain how linear regression works first.
